# Data Storage Scenario using Auth0 + Swift Native Mobile App Seed

This is the Auth0 Swift Seed project adapted to demonstrate the best practices of storing user data with Auth0. It is a native mobile app coded in Swift with a backend API created from the Auth0 NodeJS Seed project.

The scenario is a music app and the [document](https://auth0.com/docs/tutorials/User-Data-Storage-Scenario) demonstrates through this case the best practices of storing different types of data.
